# Money-For-Nothing-Problem
A solution to Problem D of the ACM ICPC 2017 World Finals - Money For Nothing.

This is a practice challenge from the past papers of the 2017 ACM ICPC World Finals. The challenge is to parse input
containing data about a series of producers and consumers of widgets. The program should be able to display the maximum
possible profit that could be obtained from buying from one producer and selling to another, based on their respective prices
and the beginning and end of their production/consumption periods. The final application does this, as well as displaying
which producer/consumer pair will yield this result.

The program could be improved by adding the ability to list multiple pairs if several combinations yielded the same result.
The UI could also upgraded to be more visually appealing, as well as possibly including a less clunky input for the
data.
